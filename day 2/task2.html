            <h2  style="text-align: center;">BTS Band (A kpop Group)</h2>
            <p>Working on my BTS blog has been a very pleasing experience for me because I have been able to share what I love about BTS. I would look forward to the times where I would have a new post to make because I genuinely love talking about BTS and it was a place where I could share my thoughts on something I love. This project has been an overall very interesting experience because under no circumstance did I think that I would be able to write create a blog about BTS for a class assignment and then receive a grade for it. It was also a fun experience because I was able to go on Twitter to look for information on BTS and do what I do on a daily basis anyways, but now I get graded for it

When writing my posts, I tried to incorporate the things I love about them and I hope that whoever read through my blog was able to learn at least one thing about BTS. There is so much more I wish I could have written about and would like to share about them. There are so many things that have been able to catch people’s attention. If I could, I would go on forever about how special of a group they are but I think I have written about the basic information needed to get to know them.

What I really wanted to gain out of this blog was to share that listening to foreign music, especially k-pop, shouldn’t be seen as such a weird thing. Music has no language and everyone has their own little thing that they like. I hope that anybody who read this came out with more of an open mind to people who like to listen to k-pop and maybe even look into these k-pop artists.

Stan BTS.

            <h2  style="text-align: center;">The Future Of BTS</h2>
            <p>BTS will continue to grow popular and continue to gain fans across the world at rapid rates. Their popularity is at all time high and they will continue to gain more fans as more people begin to accept their music. Although they have immense popularity, not all good things last forever. In Korea, there is a mandatory military service that every Korean male citizen must experience by the age of 30.

There will obviously be a hiatus for the band while the members serve the mandatory military service but I think BTS has a very long way to go. It is very common for Korean male idols to return to their groups even after their two years of military service is up. They recently renewed their contract with BigHit Entertainment for another seven years but ultimately, it will be up to the group if they wish to return, work on their solo projects, or go their own ways.</p>
